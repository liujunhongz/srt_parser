00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,370
Welcome to this advanced javascript course way you will learn concepts and techniques to transform you

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,020
from a junior javascript developer to a senior javascript guru.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,520
My name is ask him and I have over the years experience building applications for clients such as the

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,490
European Space Agency and Google.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,570
I've also been a take BP at JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley investment banks.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,420
Now I run my own digital agency in London called bubble gum and we build apps for awesome clients all

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,090
over the world and I also teach javascript angular J.S. and I only development through my company cockcrow

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,560
.

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,610
So there are already a bunch of advanced javascript courses out there.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,330
Why should you take this one.

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,850
Number one is because I value your time.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,020
If you are even a fraction as busy as I am then your time is incredibly important to me.

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,790
So I don't waste time.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,780
I've created this course to pass along the maximum knowledge with the minimum time.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,100
Now notice I didn't say minimum after this will be three hours of hard work but I promise you after

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,740
only three hours you'll have leveled up your javascript knowledge.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,460
Now the second reason I say it picked this cause is that the former is all really unique.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,450
I'm going to teach you all of these advanced topics through a series of interview questions.

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,390
We all get lazy in our jobs.

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,160
We all get comfortable with our level of knowledge and only when faced with an interview because it

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,770
forces us to try and verify our assumptions and deepen our knowledge.

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,040
It also makes for a pretty focused and practical course.

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,380
Take this in preparation for an interview or perhaps you're hiring.

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,350
I want to make sure you're asking the right questions.

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,450
Or maybe you just want the knowledge to be a better developer.

26
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,990
Whatever the reason if you want to become a senior javascript developer This cost is the cost for you

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,430
.

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,710
So what are you actually going to learn.

29
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,190
We are going to cover a number of topics in the form of a series of interview questions.

30
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,190
Now a third is going to cover just some really important basics such as what to do.

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:31,110
Use strict keyword do and does javascript pass by reference or by value with Dangote to cover the concepts

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,680
of equality and types in Javascript.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,570
So what are the different types and how do you actually make sure that two things are equal in javascript

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,420
then going to cover the broad topic of scopes in javascript so we go going to discuss the different

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,920
scopes so variable can be declared in.

36
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,610
We're going to discuss variable hoisting.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,280
We're going to discuss the scope chain.

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,510
We're going to ask what are I f is.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,660
I'm going to ask what function closures with anger and to discuss the thorny topic of object orientation

40
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,080
in javascript.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,390
We don't see discussing explain what the this key word actually means.

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,980
We're going to also explain what we call bind and apply functions do and we're then going to apply that

43
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,700
knowledge and discuss two different competing objects orientated methodologies and javascript's with

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,970
both the prototype pattern and the constructor pattern.

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,360
We're then going to cover two topics and network.

46
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,440
I believe every SR javascript developers should know and know in detail and that is what is called The

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,190
Cross origin resource sharing and what is Jason P..

48
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm going to finish with some advanced questions on events and event handling under the hood.

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,770
In javascript the ideal student for this course is an existing javascript developer.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,770
We won't be covering any of the basics on this course at the very least you need to know how to declare

51
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,360
variables in javascript.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,630
How to Create and call functions how to perform loops in javascript and breakouts of those leaves and

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,210
also how to perform string manipulation and you must have already built a javascript application of

54
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,650
at least a thousand lines of code.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,600
Now if that sounds like you feel free to take a look at the course description preview any of the lectures

56
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,180
and I look forward to seeing you on the inside

57
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,780
.
